## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Next, create the .env.local file with below content

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/
```

This project is really interesting and challenging for me, the functionals that I have done is:
- Layout the design
- Fullfill the data
- Select the object of text or asset
- Show the object or test information in the right sidebar
